## 3. Offboarding

If/when the lab member leaves the lab:


### 3.0 Commencement

- [ ] **Re-open this issue**.
- [ ] Optionally, assign someone to this issue.

    ```{note}
    It is not as important that a single person consistently handle all the offboarding steps,
    because the ex-member is not in need of guidance to get settled and get work done
    like they were during onboarding.
    ```
- [ ] Go back to "[Onboarding Status](https://github.com/neuropoly/onboarding/projects/1)" and move the card to the "Offboarding in-progress" column.
